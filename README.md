# My dotfiles

Managed with [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) cause:

- managing lots of symlinks, even with stow is pain
- gotmpl (not used yet but nice to have)
- can encrypt, can use passwordmanager
- easy install, easy update (diff!)
- cross platform

## TODO:
[] Add zsh config after cleanup
[] More requirements when I provision fresh system and find them out
[] Provisioning of apps that those configs are for - Ansible?

## Requirements

- [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for Powerlevel10k stuff
-
